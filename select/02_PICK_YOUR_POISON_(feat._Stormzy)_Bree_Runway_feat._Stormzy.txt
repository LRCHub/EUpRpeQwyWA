I know we're stuck on different pages
That rum and coke won't help you sleep
And tequila shots don't get you wasted no more
So when you pick your poison, I just hope it's me

I been thinking too much, tripping a lot, drinking too much
My coping mechanisms got me falling out of touch
I guess hard days come, don't ever wanna let you down
But if I'm honest, I just can't decide right now

One day I'll come back to you
When you show you feel it too
If it's meant to be, and our hearts agree
But for now yeah it's just me

I know we're stuck on different pages
That rum and coke won't help you sleep
And tequila shots don't get you wasted no more
So when you pick your poison, I just hope it's me

I don't want no drama, been through all the trauma
See you then I wanna, yeah yeah yeah
If we have another, I might have you one up
Sun down till the sun up, yeah yeah yeah
You can have my body if you really want to
Nobody knows my body, like you know that I do
If I drink the voddy, Imma put it on you for real

If it's meant to be
And our hearts agree
But for now yeah it's just me

I know we're stuck on different pages
That rum and coke won't help you sleep
And tequila shots don't get you wasted no more
So when you pick your poison, I just hope it's me

I know we're
I know we're... on different pages
I know we're
I know we're... on different pages
I know we're
I know we're... on different pages

When you pick your poison, I just hope it's me
