I was a fresh-faced Midwest
corn-fed kid pushing nineteen
She had a few tattoos,
one or two more years on her ID
That girl was pouring up shots
at the back of the party
Like everyone
there knew her name
I didn't know how to drink,
but I sure felt like starting
The moment that
she looked my way
She told me,
"Honey, pick your poison,
mine's a lemon and gin
With a hint,
a mix of pretty boys
in over their head
I'll admit, I'm kinda craving
the taste of something new
So, come on,
honey, pick your poison"
And I said, "Can I pick you?"
(P-pick your poison,
p-pick your poison)
(P-pick your poison)
She smiled and laughed,
put some salt on the glass
Then she threw it back with me
(Threw it back with me)
She said, "You had me at 'Hey,"
then she handed me a chase
Yeah, my face went as pink as
the Whitney
(Pink as the Whitney)
And then she took me by the hand
And said, "Boy, you better dance
'Cause this is our song now
and this is your chance
So, honey, pick your poison,
mine's a lemon and gin
With a hint,
a mix of pretty boys
in over their head
I'll admit, I'm kinda craving
the taste of something new
So, come on,
honey, pick your poison"
And I said, "Can I pick you?"
(P-pick your poison,
p-pick your poison)
(P-pick your poison)
I said, "Can I pick you?"
(P-pick your poison,
p-pick your poison)
(P-pick your poison)
I was a fresh-faced Midwest
corn-fed kid pushing nineteen
She left me a kiss
and her number on my wrist
And said,
"You know where to find me"
(You know where to find me)
She told me,
"Honey, pick your poison,
mine's a lemon and gin
With a hint,
a mix of pretty boys
in over their head
I'll admit, I'm kinda craving
the taste of something new
(Taste of something new)
So, come on, honey,
pick your poison"
And I said, "Can I pick you?"
(P-pick your poison,
p-pick your poison)
(P-pick your poison) I said,
"Can I pick you?"
(P-pick your poison,
p-pick your poison)
(P-pick your poison)
