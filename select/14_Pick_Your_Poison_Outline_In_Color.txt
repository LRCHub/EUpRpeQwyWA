Oh how the walls close in.
And then the room starts to spin
And the helplessness begins,
(Oh how the walls close in)
Just take my hand,
I'll make you well again
No one will find us where we're going.

Oh how the walls close in
The lies are counting my mother that I deceive
Found myself praying in something that I don't believe
Chaos is chaos but you don't have to die to commit suicide
Pick your Poison

Now let me destroy myself in silence
And let me just lose control with violence
I wanna feel alive and feel free again,
I just hope I survive all these demons.
This road I've wandered down is just a dead end,
And one day I'll turn around,
I just don't want to yet.

To be a demon, lost a forever broken heathen
Pick your Poison light up and breathe in
A self-made monster misconstrued with misfortune
You tied the noose
What are you going to lose!

Your cruelty clings to my broken wings
You wrote this in your scarlet letter
You're a whore for feelings
A touch me junky scraping by the skin of someone who's better

The pins been pulled! Who's going to hear the ticking time bomb baby
Time bomb baby!
The pins been pulled! Who's going to hear the ticking time bomb baby
Time bomb baby!

You've got it wrong, weakness is the body leaving pain.
You like the way it hurts the scar the stain
You're in the gutter the kind of filth that makes me shutter.
What you can't change will remain the same

Now let me destroy myself in silence
And let me just lose control with violence
I wanna feel alive and feel free again,
I just hope I survive all these demons.
This road I've wandered down is just a dead end,
And one day I'll turn around,
I just don't want to yet.

I don't think you'll ever understand .
